## 👋 Facts about me
🎨 More of a designer than developer

📍 Germany 🇩🇪

### 🥁 Interests:

- Art (Paintings, Sculptures, Literature, Music)
- Design
- Philosophy
- Theology

🔅 6 years of experience in graphical design, started with making my own Minecraft Texture Packs, still only self-taught.

🧭 Took part in a proseminar at the Hochschule für Philosophie Munich (University for Philosophy) at age 15.

💻 I code primarily to design my own apps, which is why I use AI much, but I start to really enjoy coding.

⚓ Currently, I only code with Python, but I want to start with Web Development and try C++ to improve the performance of my apps.
