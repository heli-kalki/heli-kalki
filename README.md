## Facts about me
🎨 More of a designer than developer

📍 Germany 🇩🇪

### 🥁 Interests:

🔅 6 years of experience in graphical design, started with making my own Minecraft Texture Packs.

🧭 Took part in a proseminar in the Hochschule für Philosophie Munich (University for Philosophy) at age 15.

💻 I code primarily to design my own apps, which is why I use AI much, but I start to really enjoy coding.
